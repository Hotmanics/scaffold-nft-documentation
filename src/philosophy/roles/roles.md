# Roles

Roles utilizes and measures Reputation to grant Responsibilities, Permissions, and Authorities.

These are represented through Hats. Hats is an ERC1155-adjacent collection.

A hat is an ERC115 Token. A hat contains Responsibilities, Permissions, and Authorities. Entities can wear hats. Hats can be claimed by entities based on certain conditions. 

A collection of hats is contained under the umbrella of a Top Hat. A Top Hat is simply a way to represent an organization, business, or individual. 

All Top Hats are contained under the umbrella of the ERC1155 Collection.

Reputation & Roles makes use of these capabilities. It allows for us to set up a hat(s) that can only be claimed or worn if an entity holds a certain number of Reputation Tokens.
