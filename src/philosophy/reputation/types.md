# Types
Reputation Token(s) can be represented in several unique token types, where each type changes how you can transfer the token(s).

### Transferable
ABLE to be traded freely between entities, bought/sold through Decentralized/Centralized Exchanges, staked, etc; exactly like your usual ERC20 or ERC1155 token.

### Soulbound
NOT ABLE to be traded by any means, and is meant to be used as a representation of one entity's longstanding Reputation with another entity.

### Redeemable
ABLE to be traded ONLY to addresses which hold the BURNER_ROLE. This token type is meant to reward contributors with discounts, vouchers, event tickets, etc.
